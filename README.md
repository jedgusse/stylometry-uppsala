# Welcome

This repo is meant as an additional resource for the participants of the stylometry class given in Uppsala, 10 December 2024, in context of the **Current Topics in Digital Philology** course. The Jupyter notebooks are referred to in the class slides. They introduce you, step by step, to various methodological approaches in stylometry.

You may also find the chapter "Computational Stylistics and Medieval Texts" in the series *Routledge Resources Online: Medieval Studies* useful if you like a more sweeping and shorter version of this (without the code).

For any further questions, feel free to contact me at [jedgusse.degussem@ugent.be](jedgusse.degussem@ugent.be).
